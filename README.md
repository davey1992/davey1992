# Dave - The simple things make a big difference

## About Me
I'm Dave, a passionate web developer with a wealth of experience in various technologies and a talent for crafting innovative solutions. I've finally made a GitHub repository to showcase all of my pet projects and tools that I have built over the years. While many of these projects are primarily in PHP/HTML/JS/CSS, I am looking to expand my expertise by exploring other languages and frameworks-so watch this space!

## Projects

### [Project 1: Telegram Bot](https://github.com/davey1992/Telegram-Bot)
I developed a Telegram bot using Node.js that leverages the Telegram HTTP API. This project stemmed from my participation in several Telegram groups, where I noticed the need for a more effective bot to manage group activities and combat spam. After researching existing bots and their limitations, I created a solution that sets custom rules for better spam filtering and user interaction.

### [Project 2: Image Optimiser](https://github.com/davey1992/Image-Optimiser)
With Google Page Insights scores in mind, I developed a PHP/jQuery Ajax tool to optimise JPG/PNG images and create WebP versions (a second-generation format). The tool adjusts image quality and generates WebP files using the PHP GD Library. It includes custom HTACCESS rules to ensure browser compatibility and verify file existence, providing both JPG and WebP formats. Additionally, the tool efficiently processes large volumes of images to prevent server timeouts. This feature was successfully implemented on a custom CMS, where it handled direct uploads of images.

### [Project 3: CMS Frontend (Discountinued)](https://github.com/davey1992/CMS-Frontend)
As a personal project, I set out to reskin a custom Content Management System (CMS) that I had previously developed. This hobby project led to the creation of the Image Optimiser tool, which aimed to address image-related issues encountered in my day job. Although the idea was never formally presented or fully integrated, it was a rewarding project to work on. This repository showcases the tool and highlights the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
